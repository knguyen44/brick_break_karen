The ball respawns when it hits bottom of screen, so paddle is more valuable to use.
In the Ball class, I added new method, respawnBall();. And had the Update method use it.

When balls hit bottom of the screen, lives decrease by 1.
Also, in the respawnBall(); method, I accessed the ScoreManager.Lives and simply subtracted it by 1.

When lives reach 0, everything resets. But, I couldn't get the game to restart itself (the blocks are still the same).
In the respawnBall(); method, I intialized Game1 to run game.Exit();.
